Comparing performance between Insertion-Sort and Merge-Sort

Consider the Mergesort and Insertion Sorting Algorithms. Implement these algorithms in Python. Given an input of size 𝑛 each method should return the number of comparisons (𝑛𝑐) performed. Run your algorithms for three different cases:
• A sorted array,
• A reversed array,
• A randomly created array
You will obtain the arrays by using the list of words provided in words.txt. The words in this file are sorted in alphabetical order. Run the Insertion and Mergesort algorithms for 𝑛=10,30,100,300,103,3×103,104, and all remaining words.
Create two plots of the results using any graphing tool of your choice.
Plot 1: The first plot should show the results of Insertion Sort and Mergesort using a log𝑛×log(𝑛𝑐) scale (on the 𝑥-axis log𝑛, on the 𝑦-axis log(𝑛𝑐)). You can verify the theoretical behavior of Insertion Sort and Mergesort from this plot.
Plot 2: The second plot should show the results of Mergesort using a log𝑛 scale on the 𝑥-axis only. The 𝑦-axis should show the values of 𝑛𝑐𝑛. Again show the curves for sorted, reversed, and random inputs above which are described.
You must provide an explanation for the shape of the graphs you observe for both Plot 1 and Plot 2.
